# texthooker-page
A simple Texthooker Page that displays the text from your clipboard. It is made to be used with the extension: [Clipboard Inserter](https://github.com/kmltml/clipboard-inserter)

Code is an amalgamation of https://learnjapanese.moe/texthooker.html and https://texthooker.com/ with a couple changes for my own purposes.
